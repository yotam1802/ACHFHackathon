## Features

- Our product utilizes a PHQ-9 questionnaire from the Government of British Columbia, a clinically validated  questionnaire, to assess the needs of patients and self-assess their mental health. These results are dynamically uploaded and available to the patient's physician to monitor patient progress over time.
- Additionally, we leveraged Chart.js to display aggregated data about patients to their physician, offering clear insights into mental health trends and helping inform the doctor about possible treatment options.
- Healthbridge incorporates a ChatGPT powered chatbot to provide a conservational interface for patients, offering immediate support when prompted. This provides an anonymous and informative platform to support patients.
- A selection of mental health resources can be found on the support page to accommodate any patient needs. This provides patients with the resources needed to succeed outside of clinical sessions.
